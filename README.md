Modern Java API for Nasajon Integration


Thought for 5 seconds### Modern Java API for Nasajon Integration

I'll create a modern Java API using Spring Boot to handle efficient data import and export between your application and Nasajon systems.

```typescriptreact project="nasajon-integration-api"
...
```

## Key Features of the Nasajon Integration API

This modern Java API provides a robust solution for integrating with Nasajon systems, with the following features:

1. **RESTful API Endpoints**:

1. Export data to Nasajon
2. Import data from Nasajon
3. Import data from files
4. Check integration job status



2. **Asynchronous Processing**:

1. All integration operations run asynchronously
2. Job status tracking with unique job IDs
3. Background processing with thread pool management



3. **Robust Error Handling**:

1. Comprehensive exception handling
2. Detailed error messages and logging
3. Global exception handler for consistent error responses



4. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:

1. Scheduled cleanup of stuck jobs
2. Automatic purging of old completed jobs
3. Detailed logging for troubleshooting



5. **Security**:

1. API key and client ID authentication
2. Configurable timeouts and connection settings



6. **Documentation**:

1. Swagger/OpenAPI integration for API documentation
2. Detailed API operation descriptions





## Implementation Details

The API is built using Spring Boot with a layered architecture:

- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and integration operations
- **Repository Layer**: Manages data persistence
- **Client Layer**: Handles communication with Nasajon systems


The application uses PostgreSQL for data storage, but can be configured to use other databases by changing the driver and connection settings.

## Getting Started

1. Configure the application properties in `application.yml`
2. Set the required environment variables:

1. `NASAJON_API_KEY`
2. `NASAJON_CLIENT_ID`



3. Run the application using Maven or as a JAR file


Once running, you can access the Swagger UI at `/swagger-ui.html` to explore and test the API endpoints.
